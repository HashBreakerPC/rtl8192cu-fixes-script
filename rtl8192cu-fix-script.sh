#Compatibility
#These devices are known to work with this driver:
#ASUSTek USB-N13 rev. B1 (0b05:17ab)
#Belkin N300 (050d:2103)
#D-Link DWA-121 802.11n Wireless N 150 Pico Adapter [RTL8188CUS]
#Edimax EW-7811Un (7392:7811)
#Kootek KT-RPWF (0bda:8176)
#TP-Link TL-WN821Nv4 (0bda:8178)
#TP-Link TL-WN822N (0bda:8178)
#TP-Link TL-WN823N (only models that use the rtl8192cu chip)
#TRENDnet TEW-648UBM N150
#These devices are known not to be supported:
#Alfa AWUS036NHR
#TP-Link WN8200ND
#As a rule of thumb, this driver generally works with devices that use the RTL8192CU chipset, and some devices that use the RTL8188CUS, RTL8188CE-VAU and RTL8188RU chipsets too, though it's more hit and miss.
#Devices that use dual antennas are known not to work well. This appears to be an issue in the upstream Realtek driver.
